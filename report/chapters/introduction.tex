The Simulatenous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) method employed by the AJORF (Amsterdam-Oxford Joint Rescue Forces team [[TODO: cite team description paper]] is not robust against sensor failures, which occur for example when the laser scanner is severly tilted. 

In this report, we propose a novel method which splits a map when the localization uncertainty exceeds a certain threshold. The different pieces of the map are then stitched together using a Hough transform based map stitching method.
