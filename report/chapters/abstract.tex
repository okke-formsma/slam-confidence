The structure of social networks in which entrepreneurs engaged in are deemed critical to their performance. In this work we examine the network structure and characteristics of entrepreneurs on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. Data was collected through a self-report survey that also collects the local neighborhoods for each entrepreneur on the aforementioned social networks.  

We find that for entrepreneurs the degree distribution of LinkedIn and Facebook is not scale-free but rather exponential in nature. Earlier findings suggesting that entrepreneurs with a large network perform better than those with a small network could not be replicated. We do find that strong links (connections with high betweenness) on Twitter have a high chance to be present on the other two networks as well.
