I would like to thank Yang Song and Dr. Tsvi Vinig for the guidance they provided and the valuable discussions we had over the past months. I would like to thank Yang Song specifically for access to her dataset, and Dr. Tsvi Vinig for introducing me to the field of networks in entrepreneurship. Finally, I would like to thank Paul Voskuilen for the brainstorms we had over coffee.
