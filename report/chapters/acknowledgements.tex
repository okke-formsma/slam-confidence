\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

I would like to thank Arnoud Visser for his supervision of the project. His tremendous help in understanding the UsarCommander software was also indispensible.  In addition, I would like to thank Julian de Hoog for sending me Magdalena Jankowska's thesis on Hough transform based map stitching.

I would like to thank my friends and family for their support, and in particular Leonie, who supplied the essential final deadline.
